Data Analytics on Netflix with Python
This project explores the world of Netflix content using Python for data analysis and visualization. By diving into a Netflix dataset (publicly available sources like Kaggle offer datasets), you can uncover interesting trends and insights about the streaming giant's offerings.

Here's a breakdown of the project:

1. Libraries:

pandas: for data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy: for numerical computations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: for data visualization
2. Data Acquisition:

You'll start by finding a relevant Netflix dataset. Popular options include scraped data on Netflix shows and movies containing details like title, type (movie/TV show), release year, genre, director, etc.
3. Data Cleaning:

Real-world data often has inconsistencies. You'll use pandas to identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and format inconsistencies.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

This is where you get curious! Analyze the data to gain insights. Here are some examples:
Content Breakdown:
What percentage of the content is movies vs. TV shows?
How many titles are from each production country?
Genre Exploration:
What are the most popular genres?
Is there a correlation between genre and release year?
Ratings and Reviews (if available in your dataset):
How do ratings vary by genre or release year?
Can you identify high-rated hidden gems?
5. Data Visualization:

Storytelling with charts! Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations that effectively communicate your findings.
Bar charts to compare content categories.
Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.
Word clouds to identify prominent actors, directors, or keywords.
6. Conclusion and Further Exploration:

Summarize your key takeaways about the Netflix content landscape.
What surprised you?
Are there patterns that could be useful for content recommendation or genre exploration for users?
This project lays the foundation for further analysis. You can delve deeper into specific genres, user behavior (if data available), or build recommendation models.
This is a flexible project. You can tailor it to your interests by focusing on specific aspects of Netflix content or using more advanced techniques like recommendation algorithms.
